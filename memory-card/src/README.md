MEMORY CARD REACT PROJECT

Project description/How to play The memory card game was created as a project to help with my understanding and learning of React. The game is fairly simple.

You must click on the cards and remember which ones you had already clicked on.
If you can get through every card without clicking on any twice, you'll get the highest score possible, which is 12.
Tech stack used

HTML/CSS/Javascript/REACT
I used the technologies I used because I enjoy using React as a framework. It helps simplify the act of rendering components onto the page and allows me to bundle things in a way that lets everything flow together and make sense.

Possible future additions

Improve UX/UI with play button
Render congratulatory animation for getting maximum score
Allow players to save their high scores in a list
Reflections I'm not sure if I'd call it the most complex project I've worked on so far, but it felt challenging and I felt a sense of accomplishment finishing it. The challenges I faced were dividing my components properly. I had initially put a lot of my logic into a component that it wasn't meant for and had to refactor a bunch of the code later on. I'll be more mindful of the start of my projects and work now so I don't run into the roadblock again.
